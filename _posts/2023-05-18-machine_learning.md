## Machine Learning

**One sentence to describe what is machine learning**: Show the machines examples of problems to be solved, and then it can find the methods to resolve them by itself.

Some powerful idea in the statement, "Suppose we arrange for some automatic means of testing the 
effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance and provide a 
the mechanism for altering the weight assignment to maximize the performance.", 
proposed by Samuel helps me understand the process of machine learning.

**The idea list:**

- Weight assignment

Weight is a kind of variable that can define the model operation

- Automatic means of testing the actual performance

The actual performance is the model performance. And, the automatic means can be done by setting two models and making them play against each other.

- Mechanism to improve the performance

The model performance can be improved by automatically adjusting the weight assignments
